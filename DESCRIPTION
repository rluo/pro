Description:  Optogenetics is a new tool to study neuronal circuits that have been genetically modified to allow stimulation by flashes of light.  This package implements the methodological framework, Point-process Response model for Optogenetics (PRO), for analyzing data from these experiments.  This method provides explicit nonlinear transformations to link the flash point-process with the spiking point-process.  Such response functions can be used to provide important and interpretable scientific insights into the properties of the biophysical process that governs neural spiking in response to optogenetic stimulation.
